# ðŸš— Car Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project provides a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a car dataset using Python. The analysis covers various numerical and categorical features to understand the structure and insights hidden within the data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information about cars with features such as:

- Price
- Manufacturer and model
- Production year
- Fuel type
- Gearbox type
- Drive wheels
- Engine volume
- Mileage
- Number of doors, airbags, and cylinders
- Interior material and car color

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Explore and visualize the distribution of each feature
- Identify trends and correlations
- Detect and interpret outliers
- Prepare insights for future modeling or decision-making

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Analysis Tasks

- Statistical summaries of the dataset
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots
- Correlation heatmap
- Category vs. Price visualizations

## ðŸ‘¤ Target Audience

This notebook is ideal for:

- Data science students
- Analysts interested in the automotive market
- Developers building price prediction or car classification models
